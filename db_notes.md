Good question! With this DevContainer setup, the app uses the **local PostgreSQL** that runs in the `postgres` container.

Look at the `DATABASE_URL` in `.devcontainer/docker-compose.dev.yml`:

```yaml
environment:
  DATABASE_URL: postgresql://stories_user:stories_pass@postgres:5432/stories_collector?schema=public
```

This points to `@postgres` (the local container), NOT Railway.

---

## To use Railway PostgreSQL in development:

**Option 1: Use `.env` file (Recommended)**

Create `.env.local` in your project root:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:PASSWORD@HOST.railway.app:PORT/railway
REDIS_URL=redis://default:PASSWORD@HOST.railway.app:PORT
```

Update `.devcontainer/docker-compose.dev.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  app:
    # ... other config ...
    env_file:
      - ../.env.local
    # Remove or comment out DATABASE_URL and REDIS_URL from environment section
```

**Option 2: Keep local for development, Railway for production**

This is actually the **best practice**:
- **Development**: Use local PostgreSQL/Redis (fast, no internet needed, isolated)
- **Production**: Use Railway PostgreSQL/Redis (managed, backed up, scalable)

Your current setup does this correctly! The production `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` (in the root) would use environment variables pointing to Railway.

## Current setup breakdown:

```
.devcontainer/docker-compose.dev.yml  → Local DB (development)
docker-compose.yml (root)              → Railway DB (production)
```

**In DevContainer:** 
- PostgreSQL runs locally in a container
- Redis runs locally in a container
- No Railway connection needed

**In Production (Railway):**
- Use Railway's PostgreSQL service
- Use Railway's Redis service
- Set DATABASE_URL and REDIS_URL in Railway environment variables

This is the ideal setup! You develop locally without depending on Railway, then deploy to Railway with production databases.
